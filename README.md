# Application Monitoring Dashboards

## Project Overview  
This project implements a comprehensive **Log Analytics Platform** designed to collect, process, and visualize log data in real-time. It leverages **Apache Kafka** for real-time log ingestion, a relational database for storing processed logs, and **Grafana** for dynamic visualization of key application metrics.

## Features

- **Request Count per Endpoint:** Tracks the number of requests made to each API endpoint and visualizes it.
- **Response Time Trends:** Displays trends and patterns in response times over various time periods.
- **Most Frequent Errors:** Highlights recurring errors in the application for easier troubleshooting.
- **Real-Time Logs:** Provides a live feed of logs to monitor application behavior in real-time.

## Technology Stack

- Docker (for containerization of all components)  
- Apache Kafka (for scalable and real-time log ingestion)  
- Relational Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) for structured log storage  
- Grafana (for querying and visualizing log data)  
- REST API server (implemented with 5-10 endpoints simulating workload)  
- Log producer and consumer integrated with Kafka and the postgreSQL database  

## Implementation Summary

- Developed a REST API server with multiple endpoints to simulate real workload and generate logs.
- Configured Apache Kafka with multiple topics to ingest different types of logs in real-time.
- Implemented a Kafka producer that pushes logs generated by the API into Kafka topics.
- Set up Docker containers for the API server, Kafka, Zookeeper, database, and Grafana for easy deployment and scalability.
- Built a Kafka consumer that reads logs, processes them, and stores structured data into a relational database.
- Designed and configured Grafana dashboards connected to the database for visualization of request counts, response times, error frequency, and real-time logs.
- Implemented monitoring and alerting mechanisms to support proactive incident management.
